--------------------------------------------------------------------
Files included:
- index.html : full page with Rates table and Booking form (WhatsApp)
- styles.css : styles for the page
- logo.png   : (add your logo to the zip before uploading) or GitHub fallback used

How it works:
- The booking form builds a WhatsApp message with selected route, trip type (one-way/two-way), parking selection and other details.
- Parking is an add-on; message includes parking selection so you can confirm exact charges with customer.
- To deploy: upload index.html, styles.css and logo.png to repo root (replace existing), commit and wait ~30s.
- Test form on mobile; pressing "Send to WhatsApp" opens WhatsApp with prefilled message ready to send.
