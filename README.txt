Gulati Tour and Travels — Final package for Option B (repo subpath)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Files included:
- index.html : full page with One-way + Two-way + Parking and Booking form (WhatsApp)
- styles.css : responsive styles
- README.txt : instructions

Deploy instructions for Option B (your repo path):
1. In your repository (GULATI-Tour-Travels-), upload these files to the root of the repository.
2. On GitHub Pages, if already configured to publish from main branch root, your site URL will be:
   https://gulatitourandtravels.github.io/GULATI-Tour-Travels-/
3. Commit and wait ~30 seconds for the page to be available.
4. Test booking form on mobile.

Notes:
- Place your logo image as logo.png in the repo root (it will be used in header).
- All links are relative so they work correctly under the repo subpath.
